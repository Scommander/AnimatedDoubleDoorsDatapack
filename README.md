## Introduction

This is a datapack which adds an animation to doors and allows for doors placed next to each other to open together when clicked.

(Note that the bug in the video with the particles playing when opening/closing doors has been resolved)

## How to Use & Information

Simply install the datapack and activate the resource pack. All doors you place will now be animated and all double doors will open together. Sweet 'n Simple.

Known Unfixable Bugs (Minecraft Limitations):
- Occasionality the door will appear to visually half close/open. This is due to a Minecraft rendering bug. It sorts itself out after around 10 seconds. If I can find a solution to this I will update the pack.

If you wish to uninstall the pack - just run `/function _better_doors:uninstall` and this will remove all the invisible armour stands inside each door (within loaded chunks). You can then just uninstall the resource pack and datapack and you will be back to normal.
If you have the resource pack on when you run this command it may appear as though all the doors have disappeared. They haven't! Doors are just made invisible by the resource pack - when you remove the RP they will appear again.
